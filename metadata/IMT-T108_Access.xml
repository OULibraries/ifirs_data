This recording is labeled "Indian Legal Conference" but Side 1 begins with several religious songs (in English and an unidentified American Indian language) that have been spliced together. The songs are followed by a discussion in English about the usefulness of standardized tests in schools. Side 2 of the recording is a lecture in English about employee motivation in the workplace.
